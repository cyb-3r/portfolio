				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>
					Hi! I am Cyb, your awesome pixel-artist and future developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am currently an IT student, looking forward to be a versatile
					developer in the near future. I am learning, both during classes and
					at home, many technologies related to development, whether it is for web,
					game or native applications dev.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aside from the professional stuff, I am also an artist during my
					free time. I mainly draw and animate pixel-art of characters. Other than
					pixel-art, I'm also taking my first steps in 3D rendering, I aim at making
					low-poly models for now.

				<h2>And what <em>can</em> I do?</h2>
				<p>
					Short answer: many things!
				</p>
				<p>
					In the development side of things, I use and learn many technologies on
					the daily basis. I am familiar with languages such as
					<b>C/C++</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, and <b>Go</b>.
					I also use some frameworks like <b>Symfony</b> and <b>Hugo</b>, I don't
					use frameworks that much because I like to try and make these kind of things
					by myself first.
